# Ideas!

- [X] mobile view of menu items:
      have a line break before and after the github icon.
      make sure lines are centered
- [ ] key word index:
      highlight key terms in posts using the HTML5 `<mark>` tag.
      list these words in an index on the archive page, linking to their defining post.
- [ ] clarify directory layout:
      move all content to a `_source` folder.
      I believe this might be a Jekyll v3 best practice?
- [X] 2 column minipages:
      are these possible in jekyll? used in walkthrough1 and debugging
